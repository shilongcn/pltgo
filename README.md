##3. Installation:

$ sudo make install
```   
##4. Unstallation:

```bash
$ sudo make uninstall
```

##5. How to use:

    (1) Edit a file with the command of gnuplot.         
    (2) Reserve the file as the format of ".plt".          
    (3) Put the file "???.plt" into a single folder.       
    (4) Open a terminal and enter the position of the folder.        
    (5) Just type "pltgo" in the terminal.        

##6. Notes:
    You can find the files in the folder "test". It provides the files, "plot.plt" and "energies.dat", which are used to be tested for you.

##7. Update notes:
    In this version, I modified the Makefile as the suggestion of gzstzsjâ€˜s.
